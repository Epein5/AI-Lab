# üçÖ Tomato Leaf Disease Classification with LoRA Fine-tuning

A PyTorch-based deep learning project that classifies tomato leaf diseases using custom model architecture and demonstrates the effectiveness of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning for improving classification accuracy on underrepresented classes.

## üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on:
1. Building a custom PyTorch model for tomato leaf disease classification
2. Addressing class imbalance issues
3. Implementing LoRA fine-tuning to improve accuracy for specific disease classes
